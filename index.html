<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Mihai Ivan, I am a 17 year old A Level student, that is passionate about going into an IT based role.</p>
<p>I have been passionate in the IT field since I was young, this was mainly, through the use <br>
of the visual language Scratch. Carrying on into secondary school I learned Small Basics, which made me really have a love for coding.<br>
I have since then been learning Python with elements of Pygame. I have also been recently learning HTML.</p>
