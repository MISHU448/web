<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Mihai Ivan, I am a 17-year-old A Level student passionate about entering an IT-based role.</p>

<p>I have been interested in IT since I was young, mainly through the visual language Scratch. In secondary school, I learned Small Basic, which grew my love for coding. Since then, I’ve been learning Python with elements of Pygame. Recently, I’ve also started learning HTML.</p>
